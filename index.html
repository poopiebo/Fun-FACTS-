They belong to their own unique family, Ailuridae They're Excellent Climbers: Red pandas are skilled climbers and spend most of their time in trees. They have a "false thumb" that helps them grip tree branches, which is similar to the giant panda’s adaptation.They Have a Special Diet: While they’re part of the Carnivora order, red pandas are mostly herbivores.They Communicate with Scent: Red pandas have scent glands near their tail, and they use them to mark their territory.</l1>
